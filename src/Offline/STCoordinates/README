/** \file README */

These are the files needed to make the library STCoordinates.
It deals with the transformation of coordinates such as
galactic, ecliptic, equatorial and local (horizontal).

definitions and conventions :
-----------------------------
The elevation is the angle above the horizon.
The azimuth is measured westwards from the South.
The geographical longitude is measured positively eastwards.

*************************************************
* ALL THE ANGLES ARE IN DECIMAL DEGREES EXCEPT  *
* THE RIGHT ASCENSION WICH IS IN DECIMAL HOURS. *

The conversion of GPS seconds into UTC time has been added in this version.
The time in Auger is GPS time and one must convert it into
UTC time: As of 1 January 1999, GPS is ahead of UTC by 13 seconds.
The GPS reference is 00h00 UT (midnight) on january 6, 1980. The value given
in the Auger data is the number of seconds elapsed since this date.

example :
---------
you saw an event on 14, november 1972 at 14 h 36 min 17 s UTC in Malargue
latitude = -35 degrees
longitude = -69.5 degrees (remember : positively eastwards)
so that the fraction of day is :
fracday = 0.6085300926 (using hms2day(14,36,17))
and the corresponding julian day is :
jd = 2441636.109 (using date2jd(1972,11,14+fracday,&jd))
the event has been seen with
azimuth = 134.2 degrees from south westwards
and
elevation = 37 degrees above horizon
the the galactic coordinates of the event are :
l = 249.967 degrees
and
b = 58.681 degrees.

piece of code corresponding to this example :
double latitude = -35;
double longitude = -69.5; // positively eastwards
double fracday = hms2day(14,36,17);
cout << fracday << endl;
double jd;
date2jd(1972,11,14+fracday,&jd);
double azimuth = 134.2; // from south westwards
double elevation = 37; // above horizon
double l, b;
azel2gal(latitude,longitude,azimuth,elevation,jd,&l,&b,2000);
cout << latitude << " " << longitude << " " << l << " " << b << endl;
gives
-35 -69.5 249.967424523184 58.6809812354165
