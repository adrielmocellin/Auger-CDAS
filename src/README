This is the CDAS as it runs since 31 March 2016

The Utils/* are different utilitary packages used by the CDAS processes
The Offline/* packages are copies of the v5r4 cmake CDAS release as of March 31 2016
The Apps/* contain the CDAS running processes

This new structure was built before upgrading the DAQ to handle the upgrade
